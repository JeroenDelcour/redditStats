# Reddit statistics analyses

After getting [this wonderful dataset of all Reddit submissions from 2006 to August 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3mg812/full_reddit_submission_corpus_now_available_2006/), I went off and explored the data.

So far, I've made an attempt at showing [how upvotes and comments are distributed among all Reddit submissions](http://jeroendelcour.nl/blog/Reddits-attention-inequality).
I'm also trying to show how the amount of subreddits grew over the years and their activity in a video.
